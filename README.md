# Web-Design_Challenge

*Background:*

Data is more powerful when we share it with others! Let's take what we've learned about HTML and CSS to create a dashboard showing off the analysis we've done.

*Tasks:*

The website must consist of 7 pages total, including:


A landing page containing:

  -An explanation of the project
  
  -Links to each visualizations page

Four visualization pages, each with:

  -A descriptive title and heading tag.
  
  -The plot/visualization itself for the selected comparison.
  
  -A paragraph describing the plot and its significance.
  
A "Comparisons" page that:
  
  -Contains all of the visualizations on the same page so we can easily visually compare them.
  
  -Uses a bootstrap grid for the visualizations
  
  
A "Data" page that:

  -Displays a responsive table containing the data used in the visualizations.
